## Final Checks Before Submission

### Code Repository
```bash
# Verify all files are committed
git status

# Check commit history
git log --oneline

# Verify remote repository
git remote -v

# Push final changes
git push origin main
```

### Local Testing
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should start on port 5000

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should start on port 5173

# Test all features:
# 1. Submit complaint (text)
# 2. Submit with voice recording
# 3. Submit with image
# 4. Submit in Hindi/Marathi
# 5. View dashboard
# 6. Filter complaints
# 7. Update status
# 8. Check hotspots
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- In pgAdmin, verify tables exist:
SELECT * FROM complaints;
SELECT * FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM hotspots;

-- Check data is being inserted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM complaints;
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify .env file exists in backend/
# Contains:
# - PORT
# - DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
# - GEMINI_API_KEY

# Verify .env is in .gitignore (should NOT be pushed to repo)
```
