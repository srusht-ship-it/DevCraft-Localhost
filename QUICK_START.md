   - Complaint: "Fire emergency at MG Road! Immediate help needed!"
   - Location: MG Road, Pune
3. Click Submit
4. See success message

### Test 2: View Dashboard (30 seconds)
1. Click "Dashboard" in navbar
2. See statistics cards
3. See your complaint with HIGH priority (red badge)
4. See it's routed to "Police Department"
5. Change status to "In Progress"

### Test 3: Multi-lingual (30 seconds)

- **Files**: 20+
- **Features**: 8 (All implemented)
- **API Endpoints**: 5
- **Database Tables**: 3
- **AI Models**: 1 (Gemini 1.5 Flash)

---

## What Makes This Special

1. **Complete AI Integration**: Not just keywords, actual NLP
2. **Smart Duplicate Detection**: 70% similarity algorithm
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Hotspot identification

## Common Demo Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: AI classification slow
**Solution**: First request takes 2-3 seconds (cold start), subsequent requests faster

**Issue**: Voice recording not working
**Solution**: Browser needs microphone permission, click "Allow"

**Issue**: Hotspots not showing
**Solution**: Need 3+ complaints from same location

**Issue**: Database connection error
**Solution**: Check PostgreSQL is running, verify .env credentials

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"CivicSense uses AI to automatically classify, prioritize, and route civic complaints to the right government departments. Citizens can submit issues via text, voice, or images in their local language. The system detects duplicates, identifies problem hotspots, and helps officials respond faster to urgent issues like accidents and fires."

## Questions You Might Be Asked

**Q: How does AI classification work?**
A: We use Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze complaint text and categorize it into Sanitation, Infrastructure, or Safety. The model is prompted to return only the category name.

**Q: What if AI fails?**
A: We have fallback mechanisms - if Gemini API fails, we default to Infrastructure category and use keyword matching for priority detection.

**Q: How accurate is duplicate detection?**
A: We use Jaccard similarity with 70% threshold. It compares word sets between complaints from the same location and category within 7 days.

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: Yes! PostgreSQL handles millions of records, we have database indexes for fast queries, and the backend is stateless for horizontal scaling.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: We don't log sensitive data, use environment variables for credentials, and can add encryption at rest for production.
